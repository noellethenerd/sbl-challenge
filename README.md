# SBL Deduplication Coding Challenge
## Spring Boot with Java for backend

Load server at http://localhost:8080
`./mvnw spring-boot:run`
May need to adjust environment settings/update java/maven

## React.js for frontend

To access API, add localhost:8080 as proxy
cd app `npm start`
May need to npm i to install packages
Served at http://localhost:3000

## TODO

Remove excess bulk from starter packs
Namings could be better
